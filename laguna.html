                <h2 class="story">History</h2>
                <p> Pre-Hispanic settlement in the area can be dated to prehistoric times, as evidenced in the names of towns such as Pila, Laguna, whose name can be traced to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of the rice paddy, or Pilapil.
                The written history of the province of Laguna, (Lagoon in Spanish) and that of the Southern Tagalog region, dates to 900 AD. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription is the oldest known written document found in the Philippines.
                It notes that its subject was released from a debt to the King of Tondo. A prominent figure during the time of pre-Hispanic contact is Gat Pangil, a powerful native ruler in the area.
                The towns of Bay, Pangil and Pakil were reputed to have once been a part of his domain, although accounts vary about his identity.

                <p>A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or another bay.[1][2][3] A large bay is usually called a gulf, sea, sound, or bight. A cove is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance. A fjord is an elongated bay formed by glacial action.
                    [4] The term embayment is also used for related features, such as extinct bays or freshwater environments.</p>
